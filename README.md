### Hotel Booking Test Project

This project is designed to assess various skills, including **UI design**, **networking**, **navigation**, **version control**, and proficiency in **SwiftUI**.

#### Screens:

- **Hotel**
- **Rooms**
- **Booking**

These screens offer users a seamless experience in exploring available rooms, information about the hotel, and the booking process.

#### Technologies Used

- **Combine** for Data Fetching
- **Swift Concurrency** in Booking Module

I used **Combine** for handling asynchronous events, to efficiently fetch data from the API. In the Booking Module, I leveraged the new **Swift Concurrency** features to perform asynchronous operations, particularly in the calculation of prices derived from the obtained data.

**Design Pattern**

- **MVVM** (Model-View-ViewModel)
